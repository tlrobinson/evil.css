# evil.min.css
A fork on [evil.css](https://github.com/tlrobinson/evil.css)
========
### It's just making evil.css a little bit smaller to make it easier to hide evil.css in the web.
###### Added Chinese README file (zh-cn-README.md).
### Want to know how evil.css is used? Roughly the same as evil.css, but a little different, you can find the link at the bottom.
### Have fun!
